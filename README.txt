================

A content-based video game recommendation system that utilizes reviews to describe game features.

The scraper folder contains my spiders/scrapers, as well as review data.
The vsm folder contains the source code for my Vector Space Model generator.
The cossim folder contains my Matlab cosine similarity script.

VSM.jar is a runnable jar file. To run it, you must supply it the path to the input folder (/scraper), output folder, and stopword file, in that order.

You can find the source code at https://github.com/fnrahman/game-recommender
