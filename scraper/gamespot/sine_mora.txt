  A fresh take on a stale genre, Sine Mora succeeds on all fronts. At a cursory glance, the game resembles classic side-scrolling shooters like Irem's R-Type. Once you get a taste of the back story and experience the gameâ€™s unique time mechanic, it becomes clear that the similarities to the classics are merely superficial.
