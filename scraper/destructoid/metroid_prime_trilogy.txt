Metroid Prime Trilogy is quickly becoming known as the Wii's equivalent to The Orange Box , and if you've played The Orange Box , you know how big a compliment that is. Thing is, I know there are a lot of you who still don't know about what makes Metroid Prime Trilogy so great. These three games (now available on one disk with Wii-tailored controls) tend to be either adored or ignored. I'd wager that's because most people see the word " Metroid " and "first person" and assume that immediately know what the Prime games are all about.
If you are one of those people and you haven't played a Metroid Prime game yet, why not hit the jump and see what really makes these games tick? It is quite possible that you are missing out on some of the best puzzle/action/platforming of your life.
