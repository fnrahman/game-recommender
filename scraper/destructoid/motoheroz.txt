Still, MotoHeroz is the first game to make my thumbs hurt since Super Meat Boy , so it can certainly be worthwhile for a certain type of  gamer. But perhaps the most telling thing about my time with MotoHeroz is that while I definitely enjoyed myself, it inspired me to go back and  play Trials HD some more. Pain junkies can get a quick fix of MotoHeroz methadone, but it will only tide them over until the next hit of Trials heroin shows up.
