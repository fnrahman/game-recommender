Hey guys, have you heard about this game Uncharted 2: Among Thieves ?
It's the follow-up to Naughty Dog's 2007 PlayStation 3 exclusive, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune . In the sequel, treasure hunter Nathan Drake chases the secrets of Marco Polo, falls down a lot, and blows a bunch of stuff up. The back of the box has this guy Nathan punching a dude in the face, firing a gun, and getting shot at by a helicopter.
I have to wonder: Why didn't they show off some of the cool stuff that happens in Among Thieves on the back of the box? Because there's a lot of "cool stuff" that happens... and keeps happening. For, like, over ten hours. And then more cool stuff happens online.
Hit the jump for the full review.
Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (PlayStation 3) 
 Developer: Naughty Dog 
 Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment 
 Released: October 13, 2009 
 MSRP: $59.99
It's not hyperbole to say that to date, the single-player campaign mode in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is the best, most exciting action/adventure game you'll ever play. It's not because of anything Naughty Dog did with how you control or play the game -- that remains largely the same from Drake's Fortune , which was released in 2007. It's not even because from a visual and technical standpoint, this may be one of the most impressive titles we've seen on any platform, including PC.
Score : 9.5 -- Superb (9s are a hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage to what is a supreme title.)
