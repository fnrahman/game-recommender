Rayman Jungle Run requires the smarts and reflexes of a console platformer, without the skill necessary to operate a multi-button controller.

The title Rayman Jungle Run calls to mind the shallowest of mobile gaming cash-ins: the endless runner tie-in. The recipe for such a game is simple. Take a mascot and set him on a path obstructed by procedurally generated hurdles. Slap a $2.99 price tag on the app, and pat yourself on the back. Rayman Jungle Run deserves a better title.
This unexpected ditty is the closest touch screen gaming has come to a proper platformer, and is the best surprise in the genre since, well,Rayman Origins last year.
The game is more akin to that console game than its mobile competitors. The appendage-less Rayman still skitters across a world covered in moss and sunshine, collecting fireflies and swinging from vines, dodging spikes and stomping on baddies, ultimately reaching a stage's finish line.
In both games, the goal is to get from point A to point B, with unlockable stages doled out in return for collecting all items that pock the colorful settings.
